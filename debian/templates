_Description: Merge old configuration
 This is your initial install of the checksecurity package, and you had an
 existing checksecurity.conf file from the cron package. The old
 configuration file was preserved as "/etc/checksecurity.conf.cron". If you
 had modified your configuration, you may want to merge those changes into
 the new /etc/checksecurity.conf file from this package.
